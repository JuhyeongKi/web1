  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank" title="The World Wide Web (WWW)">The World Wide Web (WWW)</a> commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.</p>
  <img src="coding4.jpg" width="100%">
  <P>The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-existed the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.</P>
